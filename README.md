# Capstone_Project_WQU

This repository was created as part of the Capstone course proyect titled "Trading on a Volatility Strategy forecasting VIX", whose aim is the following:
The purpose of this study is to first study how good is the VIX as an indicator of realized volatility, focusing on Covid period. We also use Machine Learning techniques, Light GBM, to forecast changes in VIX values; using Macroeconomics indicators as well as sentiment including information from Google Trends. Finally, we analyze a trading strategy based on trades on S&P 500, according to the forecasting of VIX and S&P 500 changes. We use data since May 2007 until August 2023.
